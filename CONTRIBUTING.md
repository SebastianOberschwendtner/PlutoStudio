# Welcome!

There are some general rules to keep the code nice and tidy:
- [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)
- [Comments](#comments)
  - [File Header](#file-header)
  - [Function Header](#function-header)
- [Commits](#commits)
- [Release Management](#release-management)
- [License](#license)

# Naming Convention
Please use the common conventions as defined in [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

# Comments
Use [Google Docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) to document the code, as the documentation is generated by [Novella](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/novella/components/templates_/hugo/).
In general try to code like the person who is reading your code knows where you live. :wink:

## File Header
The file header gives a short description of what the file does. Also the [license](#license) information is added here.

Example:
```python
""" short-description

## Description
detailed-description

### Details
- *File:*     `file-name.py`
- *Details:*  Python 3.11
- *Date:*     yyyy-mm-dd
- *Version:*  vmajor.minor.fix

### Author
your-name, :email: your-email@mail.com

---
## Code

---
"""
 ```
> The last section in this header is for the documentation to look nice.

## Function Header
Use the [Google Docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods) style.

 ## File Sections
 Try to separate *sections* within one file. Sections can be anything which combines the same content, for example function declarations or variable declaration can be sections.
 Mark them according to:
 ```python
# === section-name ===
 ```

 The following sections are usually there:
 - **Imports** : `# === Imports ===`
 - **Functions** : `# === Functions ===`
 - **Classes** : `# === Classes ===`

 
# Commits
- Commit messages should be clear and concise 
- Use **English** as far as possible.
- Use the `#` to close issues. 
- *Present* tense is **not** required, but appreciated. :wink:

Symbols for commits:
- :art: `:art:` Improvements in the *User Experience* or *New Features*
- :bug: `:bug:` Bugfix
- :racehorse: `:racehorse:` Performance Improvement
- :wrench: `:wrench:` Minor Improvement or Fix
- :mag: `:mag:` Made Code More Readable
- :8ball: `:8ball:` Add or Change Unittests
- :memo: `:memo:` Improved Documentation
- :nut_and_bolt: `:nut_and_bolt:` Hardware Uploads and Fixes
- :tada: `:tada:` Celebrate New **Major** Releases!

# Release Management
*Tags* are used for the release management. The tag number is:
- **v***Major.Minor.Bugfix*
- Document every change in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

> A release with release notes is only published on **minor** changes. Bugfixes are just pushed as tags.

# License

The following should be included in every file header:
> Adjust the name of the author according to who created the file.
